                             Now with confidence we advertise for the sophisticated product "BR500GW" for the detection of groundwater wells
                             Which includes all Systems Research Group in a compact device that is easy to use and is able to detect underground water to a depth of up to 500 meters below the earth's surface , a running measure soil resistance system and remote sensing in that one

                     Where this device can discover the large water pools only with the possibility of determining the depth of the water and we have used the system, which is a traditional Old remote sensing and a modern system to measure soil resistance
                     device and the ability to detect underground water , whether from mineral water or fresh water or salt water below the surface of the Earth up to 1000 meters in a circular motion and depth of up to 500 meters below the surface of the earth

                   <span>  Advantages and specifications of the device:</span>
                     Operates two systems
                     First system : a system of remote sensing ( energy electrostatic - static electricity ) where send waves of electrical static to depths of up to 500 meters with the possibility of determining the required depth disclosed where we have several options : 100 meters - 200 meters - 300 meters - 400 meters - 500 meters .. In addition to the possibility of choosing a distance Find the front where we can choose the 200 meters - 400 meters - 600 meters - 800 meters - the 1,000 meters<br>
                     The second system : a system to measure resistance and poor soil and be planted in the ground probe and send a signal to measure soil resistance Program to determine the type of water required disclosure and we have several options where we can choose Mineral water - fresh water - salt water<br>
                     The device runs on a rechargeable battery lasts for 10 hours continuously attached as an additional battery to replace it when needed with a car charger<br>
