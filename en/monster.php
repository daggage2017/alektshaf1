                         High performance Sensitivity VLF Operating system to the bilcam with two plates for search High adaptability Quick and easy operation system High-performance controls High-speed gold 1000 on all other single-frequency VLF gold detectors So far, there has always been a compromise between frequency and sensitivity when improving detector performance , Because the lower frequencies are more sensitive to the larger gold atoms and the higher frequencies are more sensitive to the small gold atoms when compared to the detectors, the three curves in the graph represent the ability of each detector to find small sized gold nuggets at the maximum depth possible. Most detectors will find the very large nuggets that are directly below the surface, but determine the sensitivity of the reagent to gold. The number of smaller nuggets to be retrieved in the hard ground (in the deep) is usually 18 kHz. The depth on the nuggets is greater than (or equal to) 1.0 g Compared to the basic mid-frequency detector, the 71 kHz detector will have a depth advantage on the nuggets smaller than or equal to 1.0 g. While the 1000 Gold Monster uses an advanced average frequency of 45 kHz and high speed 24-bit signal processing. This essential combination greatly enhances gold sensitivity beyond those other VLF detectors on a wide range of seed sizes, without introducing excessive noise and erroneous signals. The 1000 Gold Monster also improves the ferrous / non-ferrous characterization properties and better aligns with the conductive (saline) soil of the higher frequency detectors, making it the perfect choice for maximizing your gold extraction. Reagent sensitivity comparisons are for representation
