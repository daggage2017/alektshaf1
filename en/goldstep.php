                     With the device of the era, but the miracle of the era undisputed and no competitor of the US new global technology and specialized in the detection of gold and buried caves and space A modern American technique allows you to discover gold for depths of 30 meters Quick and convenient scanning technology makes this device the world's first device Gold Step is the world's first detector, which contains several double search systems. The device is one of the latest versions of the American B-System. The device works in several different systems. The most important is EMR technology to detect gold treasures, gold, silver, bronze, The filter is equipped with a filter made of gold to purify the signals from any impurities and filtered by 100%. The device is also equipped with Frequency Chamber technology which is a very modern technology not available in conventional devices in the market .. It provides a special frequency room for each metal onSharpness .. and thus easy to find the target and within a short time Gold Stipe Gold Detector Explanation of technology The device is equipped with very modern techniques for the detection of gold and metal buried and integrated systems between static electricity and electromagnetic energy and long-term front-scan .. Undoubtedly, the metal buried form positive magnetic fields and the caves are vacuum magnetic fields negative and therefore we can detect the metals and spaces to depths up to 30 meters through the integrated sensors and radars attached to the device and able to penetrate and sense the magnetic fields formed by the presence of metal or buried caves and spaces Gold Stipe Gold Detector Features of the device This device has been produced in a new design, unique and completely different from all other traditional devices and thus we have reached the golden generation of detectors and has been manufactured in a modern craft to be innovative and efficient and high capabilities and to suit all people who use the device, whether ordinary users or experts And even the exploration and exploration companies also owns the new form easy to carry and use, making it easy to work at all times and in all areas, whether mountainous or coastal or desert

                  <span>   device specifications :</span>

                     The device works on three programs to detect Discover gold or gold treasures - discover raw or natural gold Discover bronze or bronze treasures - Discover silver or silver treasures Discovery of caves, tunnels, tunnels, ancient tombs Detects to a depth of 30 meters .. With the feature of depth determination before starting to search. Where the user can search depths .. 6 meters - 12 meters - 18 meters - 24 meters - 30 meters Has a long-term research program. Where the user can scan the optional frontal distances 200 meters - 400 meters - 600 meters - 800 meters - 1000 meters The user can determine the depth and distance of the search before starting the work, which helps to limit the goal and know the details of the details before starting work through these specifications can be the Explorer to work in all types of soil and all terrain and the reason that the device is not affected by the type of soil or the intensity of magnetism, The device can cancel the magnetic noise in the soil and the surrounding environment to 0% and thus be the first device in the world that can work in all environmental conditions different, however harsh and rugged Download Gold Stipe Gold Detector Download The method of work and exploration We carry the device in a straight parallel to the soil and operate the device by clicking on the screen and choose the work of the long-range sensor system .. Then we determine the target to be searched for: Example (gold) After choosing gold metal search we choose the depth to reach: 6 meters - 12 meters - 18 meters - 24 meters - 30 meters) Then we determine the front scan to reach: (200 meters - 400 meters - 600 meters - 800 meters - 1000 meters) and then wait a little for the device to send waves and static energy In the form of a net to the subsoil of the earth vertically and horizontally and then we walk in the device in The area to be scanned until the device picks up any signal for the specified target, when capturing any target radar device radar movement of the direction of the target and we trace the signal of the device until it stands directly above the target after the target identification through the remote sensing system .. We install the special radar sensor and operation Audio system and start walking above the target previously specified and when issuing a sound with a visible signal on the screen of the device we have obtained a certain result up to 100% of the existence of the goal .. Start by then determine the depth and work on the extraction of the target
