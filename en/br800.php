                             We can now confidently announce that our advanced PIR 800B is the world's first sensor. For the year 2018 undisputed and no competitor achieved the old model of this device between 2010 & 2013, a great spread among the prospectors and researchers are not mentioned devices, but only talk about the device BR 800 B .

                    <span> The Golden Generation BR 800 P</span>

                     It is best suited for detecting gold, minerals and underground water where it is equipped with filters with hobbies to purify the signal by 100%. Wipe within a circle of diameter 2000 meters and reach a depth of 50 meters for metal detectors and 200 meters for the detection of groundwater. This device also has the ability to detect gold targets, whether gold from natural nuggets of gold (gold ore) or ancient gold treasures and caves and buried underground underground


                     <span>Characteristics and components of the device</span>

                     This device contains detection programs for the following elements Gold - Silver - Copper - Bronze - Iron - Lead - Aluminum - Diamond - Emerald - Underground water - Platinum - Caves and spaces ... Where the prospector can choose one type of metals to start looking for .. Example If we are looking for gold .. We are setting the device to detect gold only and available lists of the device is also available: English, French, German, Arabic - Persian - Russian - Turkish - Spanish - Italian

                    <span> User guide BR 800 P</span>

                     Is a detector of the molecular frequency provider of radars aerodynamic future to survey the surrounding land in the presence of electrostatic or electromagnetic fields formed around the metal Burnt burial for many years This device is one of the most accurate sensors in the world .. It combines the technology of remote sensing and modern electronic technologies

                  <span>   Method of use and gold detection</span>



                     The device is operated, the gold detection program is set, the probe is sent in the ground, and the aerial radars are carried in a parallel and balanced state so that they remain free and start circling around the device by carrying the aerial radars within a radius of 3 meters separating us from the device. If we are within a target area, A static electric line is issued from the device to the target and then we are directed to this target by radars to the right and left until the target is checked and confined within a square meter. This device also features advanced filters and also has antennas to validate the target. In this way, most of the mistakes faced by explorers and researchers are finally eliminated. What is meant here is that the antennas process the signal if the target is within: (wooden box tightly sealed - materials with insulating materials eg asphalt - plastic)
                    <span> Gold Detector PIR 800</span>
                     A very important observation This device can detect groundwater to depths of up to 200 meters below the surface of the earth through the program of research on groundwater Download
                     TECHNIQUES IN THE DEVICE A color LCD display shows all coordinates and results
                     American microprocessors<br>
                     The touch panel panel is convenient and practical Vibration frequency is a partial detector of 400 MHz which allows you to get very accurate results The technique of measuring the depth of targets gives an additional significant advantage to this device compared with other systems<br>
                     Within a very short time, a large area can be surveyed to detect gold, other metals, groundwater and artesian wells Built-in 9.6 volt rechargeable internal battery<br><br>
                     As well as a battery box to be used when the charging goes out Charger with indicator for charging
