                             The Spark system is based on the Advanced Distance Sensor (LDS) system and is integrated with the voice recognition system for the path and point of focus of the target. SPARK features high accuracy of frequency waves that enable it to locate and locate underground targets of gold, treasures and spaces with very precise precision. The device can locate targets from a distance of 200 meters at a 360 Â° angle with precise control in the front search space. Forward search levels can be set by the user according to their need for front scan.
