                    <span> Golden Generation BR 100 T</span>

                     The BR 100 T Golden Generation, one of the best manufactured in the world of remote sensing devices remote sensing. The old model of this device achieved between 2011 and 2013, a great spread among the prospectors and researchers, it is not mentioned devices remote sensing only are talking about the device BR 100, which became the dream of all explorers and enthusiasts to search for treasures of historical history, it is a modern scientific technology double that Enables him to capture treasures and buried in a very short time by vibrations and signals filtered by the device towards the folds of the earth at a vertical and horizontal distance. The American company BR DETECTOR has developed and upgraded the capabilities of this device to be the rare product at the top of scientific and scientific products. The golden generation of this device (BR 100 T 2018) was developed by modern and comfortable mechanical design.

                   <span>  Characteristics and components of the device</span>

                     The device operates a dual system for two types of search, providing a greater opportunity to obtain more accurate results that enable the discovery of the target Survey large areas in a very short period of time Download Possibility to adjust the device to detect the following items: Gold - Caves - Silver - Bronze It detects depths up to 25 meters where we can choose the depth to be searched for from a digital laser detector Antennas are retractable at the top of the device according to the system of free movement antennas Has been manufactured and developed to be the first in the world and specializes in the detection of raw gold and gold factory, caves and tunnels and basements under the surface of the ground to a depth of 25 meters and the front of 1000 meters. The device also has two search and access features It is operated by remote guidance without the need to implant ground sensors and access to gold and caves through the guide

                    <span> Detection of gold and minerals</span>

                     We carry the device in a straight line parallel to the soil and operate the machine by clicking on the screen and selecting the target to search for: Example (gold) We choose the gold metal and then we choose the depth we want: (5 m - 10 m - 15 m - 20 m - 25 m) We then select the appropriate front range for the search according to the area of ​​the area we want to search,
                     (200 meters - 400 meters - 600 meters - 800 meters - 1000 meters) and then wait a little for the device to send signals and vibrations in the ground in the form of vertical and horizontal and then walk in the device in the area to be scanned until the device to pick any signal of the metal that We have chosen it, when picking up any target radar device moving hydraulic radar to go towards the target and we follow the signal of the device until it stands directly above the target and determine the depth of the target accurately<br>
                     Two years guarantee<br>
