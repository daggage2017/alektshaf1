                     <span>  BR700 PRO</span>


                     That was made in (BR US) company to be in first place in the world, it was produced in professional ways and high quality and unique specifications which make it sophisticated and complete device to all searches and exploration of underground water

                     Through this device the user can determine the whereabouts of the water in the area to be scanned. And determine the best water points in this area

                     It has been provided with water depth knowledge feature, where you can determine the depth of the water detected directly on the screen

                     It can also distinguish between fresh and salt and mineral water in case the water discovered, immediately it shows the water quality on the screen

                    <span> Device specifications</span>

                     The device has an LCD modern screen provided with operating program (Software) modern and easy to use
                     BR700-pro can discover to 700 meters as depth
                     It specifies the location of water and limit the strongest point of water within an area of ​​up to 1,000 square meters through cables attached
                     The device appears on the screen automatically and immediately type of water discovered (water quality fresh water - salt water - mineral water)
                     Anyone can use this device with ease. Unlike some other devices that are difficult for some prospectors working on them
                     Signals and the accuracy of the device doesn't affected by the rocky soil or sand or clay
                     This device is equipped with full integrated electronic system
                     The device works accurately at temperatures ranging from 20 degrees below zero to 55 degrees Celsius
                     It runs on 12-volt battery and operate for 12 hours
                     Light weight and ergonomic device
                     The machine is designed from high-quality electronic and durability of plastics
                     The device supports working languages: English and French
                     Made In USA

                     <span>Device working program</span>
                     The device working in SRB ,, which is a developed idea of measuring the global soil, which is based on sending shocks and electric waves into the ground, where you measure all the soil frequencies and analyzed to show a graphic readout on the main screen, and the device was provided with resist electronic test that gives the same water resistance to ensure the validity of the device

                     <span>Search Options</span>
                     Automatic Search
                     In the beginning we set 4 probes those coming attached with the device in the form of a square or a rectangle,, and then connect the cables between the probes and the device after that we switched on the device and then choose the device language

                     Then choose the automatic search, and wait until a comprehensive survey among four probes, then the result will appear on screen indicating the whereabouts of water between probes planted clearly

                     Example: between the probe 1 to 2 There is water - water type: fresh - the depth is 150 meters
                     Example: between the probe 2 to 3 There is water- water type: fresh- the depth is 150 meters
                     Example: between the probe 3 to 4 there is no water
                     Example: between the probe 1 to 4 there is no water
                     After results of search are appear we go to the place that has been confirmed water in it. And we do a manual search between two probes, only without the need for a full search for the four probes, and we make inventory through approximation of the probes to each other until the inventory of water will inside a smaller space and this small area is the best place to start digging and which has the strongest point of water .
                     Manual Search
                     Manual search is different from automatic search because from manual search can set two probes in the ground only without need to set four probes and we setthe probes in the ground to check specific place in exact area (for example)
                     Search between probe 1 and probe 2 only
                     Search between probe 2 and probe 3 only
                     Search between probe 4 and probe 1 only
