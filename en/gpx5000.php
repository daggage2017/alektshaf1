   Improved electronics and new standards, an amazing array of features combined with GPX's legendary ability to "discover through the solid ground", gives you a great advantage in depth detection. Using unique features, industry-leading patented technology ensure GPX detection is smooth and quiet running even in difficult ground conditions, while still maintaining excellent depth and sensitivity to gold nuggets. GPX detectors find gold much deeper than any other detectors, in all situations on the ground. For this reason we are confident to say our depth advantage in GPX devices. With more timing than ever, 8 software available on the GPX 5000 to change the digital switching and electronics processing in the detector. Each timing has been designed to achieve optimum performance under certain conditions, so having such different timings each time you select the new timing gives you the exact detection feature. Also these devices are for researchers and jewelry hunters who are demanding in the best, and wants to explore the targets in the deepest depths ever. : Advantages SETA, DVT & MPS technology The device is designed with this technique that allows the device to make clear sounds in the event of a target of gold, whatever its size is small Search modes: The current device has three additional modes that exceed the previous device, namely detection of effects, pure gold and gold mixtures to allow the use of the device in many ways Pure Gold Detection Mode: This mode allows for the detection of pure raw gold with great depths and high sensitivity Gold detection status in salt areas: This mode allows for the detection of gold in areas with relatively saline soils as in the shores of the seas and oceans and other places Impact Detection Mode This mode has been improved to make the device more sensitive to detecting ancient artifacts and objects more easily Depth of Depth: This position provides the device the possibility of detection of depths greater than 3 meters High Sensitivity of the Device: The sensitivity of the device has been enhanced in order to determine more accurately the targets detected in the ground Automatic soil calibration: The device is set to automatically calibrate the soil, regardless of the type of soil or layers within the ground Audio adjustment: New options for adjusting the volume or type of sound are available under the device for personal use Iron Canceling Feature: This feature has been developed in case of de-detection of iron metal during detection Backlit screen: Allows you to see the device's screen at night or at any time during the day with automatic daytime daylight adjustment to save battery consumption Light-weight battery: Lithium lasts long hours Two types of disks: Provided for multiple search options of first type Measuring 11 "DOUBLE - D And the second type of measurement 11 inches MOMOLOP Also to secure all possible and appropriate search options Languages: English, Spanish, Russian, Arabic - Manual only
