                             The manufacturer has successfully integrated the Deep Hunter Pro system, which combines deep surface research and deep search at the same time for the first time in the world, the latest in gold and metal detection technology and consists of two different systems. The first system has the ability to detect metals, ground spaces, stores, cathedrals and caves within the depths. The second system is characterized by accuracy and high speed in the detection of small targets and coins and you can cancel the property of iron and detect precious metals, jewelry and treasures only and has a high sensitivity and rapid detection of this type of metal

                   <span>  First mode:</span>
                     Designed for detecting metals, ground spaces and treasures on the LCD screen In this mode, the standard T44 search disk uses 36X44cm, giving you the opportunity to search in areas where exploration has been carried out, in addition to easy detection and identification of metals and treasures for depths of up to 5 meters. For users who want more depth, the optional T100 is designed as the 60X100cm large search disk and has the ability to set large targets in deep places. Up to 12 meters This mode is designed for amateurs and professionals for easy use thanks to the unique workflows that determine the type and depth of the goal as well as to clarify the shape of the target by the graph on the screen Distinguish metals with high precision 3D by graph After defining the target, a three-dimensional analytical report is presented in addition to the type of metal detected. It has the ability and the high precision in the process of metal recognition and identifies the target name on the screen if gold or other kind of precious metals or precious metal besides the iron, these four different groups are detected and analyzed on the screen Depth Determination The depth of the target is determined in centimeters at high resolution Identification of caves and ground spaces The targets are identified and identified in a highly accurate manner, in addition to the identification of the ground spaces and caves where minerals are located, identifying the type of minerals within the caves, tunnels, caches and structures that resemble tombs. All these types of metals and ground spaces are marked on the screen in a three-dimensional format with different sound tones being alerted to each metal Convert the target signal to a graph System 1 is a signal-signal system that converts the target signal into a graph as well as clarifies the target shape in real-time on the screen Shut off the iron It has the ability to cancel iron and discard metal waste and to detect precious metals only. This is a feature of the features that allow the user to search convenient Download Second mode: The audio system is fast and deep. It is specially designed to detect small metals and coins. It detects targets by sound alert tones In this system the standard search disk uses 26X32cm and it helps in detecting coins, jewelry and other small objects as well as you can easily access the depths you want to access as in the system C471 is the optional search disk 47X39cm When using this disk you can reach deep goals Easy to use and has a high ability to distinguish metals and the process of discrimination by three different tones of gold and precious metals and non-precious Cancel iron As in System 1, this preparation is used to eliminate iron and useless metals and metal wastes, enabling you to detect metals
