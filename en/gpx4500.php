                             The return of the legendary gold detector! GPX-4500 is a proven gold finder with many features and wonderful performance at various times. The superior multi-sensor integration of MINELAB's (MPS), Dual-Voltage Technology (DVT) and Intelligent Time in Electronic and Alignment Technologies (SETA) penetrates the ground for better and deeper metal detection than previous PI core technical detection.               </p>

                     <span>  Advantages:</span>
                    MPS, DVT SETA, superior gold technologies for gold detection which is the most advanced technology for underground detection no matter how small the size of the depth up to 2 meters Search modes: The device was modified by adding more different modes to suit the different possibilities during the search process and in a way that gives greater sensitivity to detect the goals, whether small or large and with high precision Six ways to search: Within the device, 6 different types of search methods are available to suit all possibilities for use and you can modify these methods to suit your search method Automatic Soil Calibration: The machine has the advantage of automatic calibration of the soil in a way that provides great effectiveness during the search process and all types of soil, whether rock, sand, saline or mud Backlighting Your monitor has backlighting to allow you to read screen information at night or in dark places. With the possibility of adjusting the degree of light to maintain the battery power for as long as possible Volume control: The device provides multiple options to control and adjust the volume in accordance with the nature of your research and the device is equipped with filters of sound from external influences to provide accurate results when issuing sound on the presence of the target Improved Characterization: The properties of the device have been improved so that they can distinguish metals more accurately and to separate targets from other objects that may overlap with them to provide accurate results Speakers: The speakers within the device allow the user to hear the signals of the targets more easily because of the use of high-quality materials that provide a clear and clear sound and not caused by noise or external factors Batteries: Light-weight lithium and lasts for long hours
