                             is one of the world’s most versatile gold nugget detectors. Operating with Minelab's exclusive triple frequency technology the Eureka Gold makes prospecting easier than ever before. The Eureka Gold gives you 6.4kHz for maximum depth, 20kHz for general detecting and the super sensitive 60kHz to find the smallest gold nuggets that others are missing.
