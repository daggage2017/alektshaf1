                     BR 20 G Of the series of famous US system systems The company and factories of the US B-System surpassed all its counterparts from other similar international factories. Its equipment has proven to be highly efficient in exploring and exploring gold and minerals underground. It is the most widely used equipment in the world, Device BR 20 G The Golden Generation of America's newest and best detection device in the world for 2018 The product is one of the most widely used detectors in the world for researchers and prospectors for gold, which is a system of research and exploration of high precision and effectiveness, and has been manufactured by experts and engineers specialized in the manufacture of these devices for many years. A modern electronic model is the reason for the actual shift in the world of exploration and exploration equipment for gold, and it is distinguished from other traditional devices with the accuracy of the signal sent and future, which is the most important in the detection of targets and determination without being affected by natural soil factors such as mineral rocks, volcanic and mineral dense soil If you are a researcher, explorer or hobbyist and look specifically for gold, you can now discover underground gold through this effective, high-tech product, unique and exclusive specifications. You do not need a range of devices or other large-sized devices. Now, with the BR 20 G, you can discover underground gold in a very short time and determine its depth with extreme precision. And anyone can use this device and work it easily without any complications<br>

                  <span>   Explanation of technology:</span>

                     The device has been equipped with very modern techniques for detecting gold and natural crude gold and was integrated between the power of static and long-term front scan There is no doubt that the gold buried in the soil form magnetic fields and electrical static and positive formed over a period of time as a result of burial in the soil, and therefore these fields formed around the hidden gold helps the device to discover the gold accurately and accurately and speed is located gold from far distances to walk Reach the target completely and stand above directly The device can detect gold and penetrate the soil to depths of up to 5 meters through sensors and radar integrated device and able to penetrate and feel the magnetic fields formed by the presence of hidden gold This product is equipped with modern technology available only with the products of BR System exclusively American, the frequency chamber and this room contains a small piece of pure gold for the passage of frequency across which contribute to the transmission of signals and frequencies are 100% correct and away from any other metal object such as metals found In rocks or other impurities<br>
